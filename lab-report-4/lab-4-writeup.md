# Lab Report 4

## Step 4:
* **Keys pressed**: s, s, h , k, 2, y, a, n, @, i, e, n, g, 6, -, 2, 0, 1, ., u, c ,s, d, ., e,
  d, u `<enter>`
* Screenshot:
* This allows me to log into the remote server without having to enter my password
  because I have connected the SSH key from my computer to the remote server.

## Step 5: 
1. **Keys pressed:** c, s, 1, `<tab>`, `<enter>`
* Screenshot:
* This is because I wanted to do work for CSE 15L, so I moved to the inside of that directory. By using the <tab> button, I was able to autofill the rest of the command without typing anything myself. 

2. **Keys pressed:** g, i, t, c, l, o, n, e, `<command>` `<v>`, `<enter>`
* Screenshot: 
* In order to clone the repository using my ssh key, I typed in the git clone c
  ommand then used the `Command-V` command in order to paste the password-protected
  SSH key into the terminal without making any spelling mistakes.

## Step 6:
1. **Keys pressed:** l, s, `<enter>`
 * Screenshot: 
 * In order to find the name of the directory, I used `ls` to list out all of the
   directories.

2. **Keys pressed:** c, d, l `<tab>`, `<enter>`
* Screenshot: 
* I then had to move into the directory for lab7 in order to run the tests inside
  of it. I typed `cd`, then `l` and tab to autofill the rest of the directory name,
  so that I didnâ€™t have to type it out myself.  

3. **Keys pressed:** `<up>` `<up>` `<enter>`
* Screenshot: 
* Once I was inside the lab7 directory, I needed to know where the test files were
  located, so I used the up arrow twice in order to access the `ls` command I had
  run that was now stored in the search history. I then ran it to find the name of
  the tester files.

4. **Keys pressed:** b, a, s, h, t, `<tab>`, `<enter>`
* Screenshot: 
* I needed to use the `bash` command to run the test.sh file, so I typed bash and
  then t, which is the first letter of the test.sh file. Then I used `tab` to
  autofill the name of the file before running the command.

## Step 7
1. Keys pressed: v, i, m, L, i, `<tab>`, ., `<tab>` `<enter>`
`<down>` `<down>` `<down>` `<down>` `<down>` `<left>` `<left>`
* Screenshot:
* In order to get to the incorrect line in the ListExamples.java file, I had to navigate down a
few lines in the code, until I reached that line, and then moved left through the line until I
was one space to the right of the word index1 in the third while loop. I noticed that it was  
2. Keys pressed: i
* Screenshot: 
* I used the key `i` in order to enter insert mode in vim so I could edit the code in the
  ListExamples.java file. After I pressed this key, the word `INSERT` appeared at the bottom of
  the terminal window. 
3.Keys pressed: `<delete>` `2`
* Screenshot: 
* After I had navigated to the correct position (1 space to the right of the word index1), I
  then used the delete key to remove the `1` and replace it with the number `2`, so that the
  correct index was being updated. 
4. Keys pressed: `<esc>`
* Screenshot: 
* To quit from the insert mode in vim, I used the `esc` key in order to return to the normal
  state
5. Keys pressed: `:`, w, q `<enter>`
* Screenshot: 
* In order to save the changes I made while I was in vim, I typed in `:wq` and then exited back
  to the terminal window.
