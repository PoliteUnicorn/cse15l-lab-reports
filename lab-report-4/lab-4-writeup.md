# Lab Report 4

## Step 4:
Screenshot:
* Keys pressed: s, s, h , k, 2, y, a, n, @, i, e, n, g, 6, -, 2, 0, 1, ., u, c ,s, d, ., e, d, u <enter>
* This allows me to log into the remote server without having to enter my password
  because I have connected the SSH key from my computer to the remote server.

## Step 5: 
Screenshot:
1. Keys pressed: c, s, 1, <tab>, <enter>
* This is because I wanted to do work for CSE 15L, so I moved to the inside of that directory. By using the <tab> button, I was able to autofill the rest of the command without typing anything myself. 

Screenshot:
2. Keys pressed: g, i, t, c, l, o, n, e, <command> <v>, <enter>
* In order to clone the repository using my ssh key, I typed in the git clone c
  ommand then used the `Command-V` command in order to paste the password-protected
  SSH key into the terminal without making any spelling mistakes.

## Step 6:
Screenshot:
1. Keys pressed: l, s, <enter>
 * In order to find the name of the directory, I used `ls` to list out all of the
   directories.

2. c, d, l <tab>, <enter>
* I then had to move into the directory for lab7 in order to run the tests inside
  of it. I typed `cd`, then `l` and tab to autofill the rest of the directory name,
  so that I didnâ€™t have to type it out myself.  

3. <up> <up> <enter>
* Once I was inside the lab7 directory, I needed to know where the test files were
  located, so I used the up arrow twice in order to access the `ls` command I had
  run that was now stored in the search history. I then ran it to find the name of
  the tester files.

4. b, a, s, h, t, <tab>, <enter>
* I needed to use the `bash` command to run the test.sh file, so I typed bash and
  then t, which is the first letter of the test.sh file. Then I used `tab` to
  autofill the name of the file before running the command.
